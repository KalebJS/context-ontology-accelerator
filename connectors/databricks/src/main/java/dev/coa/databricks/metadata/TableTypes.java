/**
 * Which {@code information_schema.tables.table_type} values this connector exposes. A constant rather
 * than configuration, so there is no second implementation for it to disagree with.
 *
 * <p>Databricks never says {@code 'BASE TABLE'}. It returns {@code MANAGED}, {@code EXTERNAL},
 * {@code VIEW}, {@code MATERIALIZED_VIEW}, {@code STREAMING_TABLE}, {@code FOREIGN},
 * {@code MANAGED_SHALLOW_CLONE} and {@code EXTERNAL_SHALLOW_CLONE}, so the filter every other
 * {@code information_schema} dialect writes, {@code table_type IN ('BASE TABLE', 'VIEW')}, discards
 * every table. And it does not return nothing, because {@code 'VIEW'} is a Databricks value: on an
 * eleven-row fixture schema it returns one row, the view. A steward then sees a source that scanned
 * successfully and contains views but no tables, which reads as a permissions problem rather than a
 * dialect bug.
 *
 * <p>Three types are excluded. {@code FOREIGN} is a table federated into Unity Catalog from somewhere
 * else, and reading it through two federation layers is slower and less faithful than onboarding its own
 * source, besides hiding which system owns the data. {@code MANAGED_SHALLOW_CLONE} and
 * {@code EXTERNAL_SHALLOW_CLONE} are copy-on-write clones whose rows duplicate another table's, and
 * including them would put the same facts in the ontology twice under two names.
