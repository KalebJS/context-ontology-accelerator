"""Identity resolution for the invoke entrypoint.

Trust Model
-----------
There are two trusted sources of user identity, depending on the caller:

1. **JWT in Authorization header** (highest trust): AgentCore validates the JWT
   (signature, expiry, audience) before forwarding the request. We decode without
   signature check because AgentCore already did that. This gives us the 'sub'
   (user_id) and 'email' claims. The data-layer Lambda also forwards the original
   JWT when invoking via AgentCore, so JWT is always present for authenticated callers.

2. **profile.userId** (fallback only): For any future internal caller that invokes
   the runtime without forwarding a Bearer token. This path should NOT override
   a validated JWT since the request body is attacker-controlled for direct callers.

Priority: JWT sub > JWT email > profile.userId. The JWT takes precedence because
it is cryptographically validated by AgentCore before the request reaches this code.
The profile path is a fallback for edge cases where no JWT is forwarded.

_resolve_user_id does NOT perform token validation itself. It trusts that
upstream infrastructure (AgentCore Runtime) already verified the token before
the request reached this code.

    The single source of truth for the JWT-over-body precedence that both the
    namespace admission gate and the Tier-1/2/3 query path feed into
    ``resolve_profile`` / Cedar. Extending :func:`resolve_user_id` to also return
    ``groups`` keeps that trust decision in one place instead of duplicated inline.

    Precedence (JWT is authoritative — the body is attacker-controlled for direct
    Playground callers, so it must never override the AgentCore-validated token):

    * ``user_id``: JWT sub → JWT email → ``profile.userId`` → ``profile.email``.
    * ``groups``: the JWT groups whenever a JWT identity was extracted (even if the
      list is empty — an authenticated caller with no groups is not the same as an
      unauthenticated one); only with NO JWT at all do we fall back to
      ``profile.groups``. A comma-joined string is normalized to a list, and any
      other type is discarded — ``profile`` is attacker-controlled on the direct
      path, so a malformed ``groups`` (int, dict, nested list) must not escape this
      function and violate the ``list[str]`` contract its callers rely on.

    Does NOT validate the token — AgentCore did that upstream (see module docstring).

    ``profile["userId"]`` is the JWT ``sub`` — a Cognito UUID or equivalent, and

    one claim every IdP guarantees. It means nothing to the person reading it, so
    prefer the ``email`` claim when the role resolver injected one: the Playground
    renders these values verbatim, and "alice@example.com" tells the reader whose
    grants produced the answer where a UUID does not.

    A display label only — it never feeds authorization, which reads ``userId``.
    The substitution is honest rather than cosmetic: email IS a principal identity
    in the grant model (:func:`role_resolver.build_principal_keys` resolves grants
    under both ``User::<sub>`` and ``User::<email>``), so the two name the same
    principal. Only the JWT-derived email reaches the profile — ``main.py`` strips
    a client-supplied ``email`` before ``ResolvedProfile.inject_into`` writes the
    validated one — so this cannot be spoofed by the request body.
