"""Execute a single Athena statement and return all of its rows.

Metadata discovery for a Lambda-backed (custom connector) Athena catalog is done
with Athena SQL — ``SHOW DATABASES``, ``SHOW TABLES``, ``DESCRIBE`` — because the
Athena metadata *API* drops the column comments this feature depends on. That
makes correct, complete, loud statement execution a discovery primitive rather
than a convenience, which is why this is a module of its own rather than a reuse
of :class:`~.athena_sampler.AthenaSampler`.

``AthenaSampler._run`` is deliberately NOT reused. It is built for a bounded
sampling query and is unsafe for ``DESCRIBE`` on three counts:

* it issues a single ``get_query_results`` with ``MaxResults=200`` and never
  follows ``NextToken``, so it silently truncates — a table wider than that
  loses columns with no error;
* its deadline is 30 s; and
* every failure path yields ``[]`` — a non-``SUCCEEDED`` state and a timeout
  return it directly, and ``_sample_one_guarded`` swallows exceptions one level
  up. For sampling that degrades to "no sample values", but here it would make a
  failed ``DESCRIBE`` indistinguishable from a table with no columns.
  ``DESCRIBE`` is the only source of columns for this connector, so that
  ambiguity would silently ship a table stripped of its columns, comments, and
  keys — and enrichment would then backfill AI descriptions over the gap.

Hence the two rules this module holds to: **paginate to exhaustion**, and **raise
rather than return a short answer**. Every ``return`` of rows here is a statement
that Athena reported ``SUCCEEDED`` and that we read to completion.

Result shapes, verified live against a Lambda-backed catalog (they are not
documented, and they drive the two decisions below):

* ``SHOW``/``DESCRIBE`` report ``StatementType == "UTILITY"`` and return **no
  header row** — the first row is already data. ``SELECT`` reports ``"DML"`` and
  *does* repeat the column names in row 0. An unconditional ``rows[1:]`` strip
  (what the sampler does, correctly for its own ``SELECT``) would therefore eat
  the first database, the first table, or the first column here.
* ``DESCRIBE`` advertises three columns (``col_name``/``data_type``/``comment``)
  but returns each row as a **single** cell holding all three fields
  TAB-separated. Splitting that belongs to the caller; this module hands back
  cells verbatim so the shape stays visible to the code that has to tolerate it.
