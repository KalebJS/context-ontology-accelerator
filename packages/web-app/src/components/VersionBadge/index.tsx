 * Fixed badge in the bottom-left corner showing the deployed monorepo version
 * (e.g. `v0.2.2`). The value comes from `runtime-config.json` (`version`),
 * which CDK writes from the repo-root VERSION file at deploy time — so the badge
 * always reflects what is actually deployed, with no rebuild.
 *
 * Renders nothing when the version is absent (older config, or local dev before
 * `fetch-runtime-config.sh` has run) so it never shows a broken `v`.
 * `pointer-events: none` keeps it from intercepting clicks on the nav beneath it.
