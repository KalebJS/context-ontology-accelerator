/**
 * Guards Cloudscape `trackBy` and `sortingField` string literals against field
 * renames.
 *
 * Both are typed as plain strings and resolved by index (`item[key]`), so
 * TypeScript cannot tell that `trackBy="ontology_id"` no longer names a field
 * once `OntologyRecord` moved to camelCase. A stale literal yields `undefined`
 * for every row: `trackBy` then gives every `<tr>` the same React key, and
 * `sortingField` silently sorts on nothing. Neither throws.
 *
 * The camelCase migration missed exactly this in GetNamespace.tsx and the whole
 * suite stayed green, so it is asserted structurally here rather than through a
 * rendered test (the tables in question are mocked to zero rows, and React only
 * *warns* on duplicate keys).
 *
 * Two scopes, deliberately:
 *   - the *stale-name* rule sweeps every page, since a snake_case
 *     `OntologyRecord` field is wrong wherever it appears and needs no allowlist;
 *   - the *known-key* rule covers only the OntologyRecord-backed tables. An
 *     allowlist spanning all pages would have to enumerate every unrelated row
 *     type (grantId, tableId, dataType, …) and would drift into noise.
