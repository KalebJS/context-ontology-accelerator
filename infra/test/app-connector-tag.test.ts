/**
 * The build-time half of the connector invoke policy.
 *
 * `DenyAthenaInvokeOfUntaggedFunctions`, on both the serve and the discovery role,
 * denies an Athena-mediated `lambda:InvokeFunction` on every same-account function
 * that does NOT carry `coa:connector`. The exemption is what lets a connector
 * deployed alongside this stack be reached at all — see serve-stack.ts and
 * sources-stack.ts.
 *
 * Its residual is one of OUR OWN functions acquiring that tag: it would become
 * Athena-invocable, which is precisely the escalation the Deny exists to close. An
 * Athena UDF (`USING EXTERNAL FUNCTION ... LAMBDA '<arn>'`) needs only
 * StartQueryExecution — held for every user question — plus InvokeFunction, and
 * serve's SQL is LLM-generated, so the vector is plausibly reachable by prompt
 * injection.
 *
 * That residual is closed HERE rather than with a second runtime tag, because a
 * second tag applied at the same scope degrades to the first one and only moves the
 * problem. CDK's `Tags.of(scope).add(...)` propagates to every taggable child, so
 * the realistic path is one line in a stack — which is what this asserts against.
 *
 * A source assertion rather than a template one: `infra/bin/app.ts` is a script
 * that reads SSM at module scope (`void deploy()`), so it cannot be imported and
 * synthesised in a unit test. Reading the source covers every stack in the app
 * including ones added later, which per-stack template assertions would not.
